          Jewellery consists of decorative items worn for personal adornment,
          such as brooches, rings, necklaces, earrings, pendants, bracelets, and
          cufflinks. Jewellery may be attached to the body or the clothes. From
          a western perspective, the term is restricted to durable ornaments,
          excluding flowers for example. For many centuries metal such as gold
          often combined with gemstones, has been the normal material for
          jewellery, but other materials such as glass, shells and other plant
          materials may be used. Jewellery consists of decorative items worn for
          personal adornment, such as brooches, rings, necklaces, earrings,
          pendants, bracelets, and cufflinks.
